/**
 * This is a simplified version of the HelloJSFIntegrationTest.  Instead of using
 * HttpUnit and JSF API's, it uses JSFUnit's JSFClientSession and JSFServerSession classes
 * to do most of the work.
 * 
 * JSFUnit is designed to allow complete integration testing and debugging of
 * JSF applications at the JSF level.  In short, it gives you
 * access to the state of the FacesContext and managed beans after every
 * request.  With the FacesContext in hand, you are able to do integration testing
 * of JSF applications at the proper level of abstraction.
 * 
 * The typical usage pattern of JSFUnit is to submit a request with httpunit and then
 * examine both the raw HTML output (httpunit tests) and JSF internals (JSFUnit tests).
 * The httpunit-style tests are not shown here.
 * 
 * The JSFUnit tests below demonstrate testing:
 * - Navigation:      "Did this input take me to the correct view?"
 * - View Components: "Does the JSF component tree contain the correct components?"
 *                    "Do these components have the expected state?"
 * - Managed Beans:   "What is the state of my managed beans?"  This can include managed beans in
 *                    Seam-defined scopes such as conversation scope.  The tests below only
 *                    demonstrate request scope, but you can find anything reachable with the EL.
 * - Validation:      "Does invalid input generate the proper FacesMessage and error to the user."
 * 
 * Tests not shown below:
 * - EL Expressions:     You use the Expression Language (EL) to examine the state of your
 *                       managed beans.  JSFUnit allows you to invoke any EL expression.
 *                       So, it is also possible to use the EL to invoke actions
 *                       from JSFUnit without submitting a request.  This is not deomonstrated
 *                       below, but it is relatively easy to do.
 * - Application Config: Because you have access to FacesContext, you can also call
 *                       FacesContext.getApplication().  From there you can test to make sure
 *                       your application configuration is correct.  This would include tests
 *                       for proper installation of converters, validators, component types,
 *                       locales, and resource bundles.
 * 
 * This class tests the HelloJSF application.  This is a simple Hello World
 * application written in JSF with a single managed bean bound to the name "foo" in request scope.
